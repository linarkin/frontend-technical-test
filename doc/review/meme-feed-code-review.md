# Code Review: MemeFeedPage Component

## Summary

This review identifies why the original `MemeFeedPage` component had performance issues and how the new version fixes them.

## Problems in the Original Code

1. **Fetching All Data at Once**: The original code tries to load every meme, all at once, before showing anything to the user. It also fetches every author and every comment for each meme.

2. **Sequential API Calls**: It makes one API call at a time in a loop, waiting for each to finish before starting the next. This includes fetching authors and comments for each meme.

3. **No Data Caching**: The code doesn't store fetched data for reuse. If an author has multiple memes or comments, their data is fetched multiple times.

### Consequences

- **Slow Loading Times**: Users have to wait a long time before anything appears on the screen.
- **Unresponsive UI**: The app doen't show anything but a loading spinner.
- **High Server Load**: Making many API calls puts stress on the server, which can affect performance for all users.

## Improvements in the New Code

1. **Pagination**: The new code fetches memes one page at a time. Users can navigate between pages, reducing the amount of data loaded at once.

2. **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Author data is fetched separately and doesn't block the rendering of memes. The UI shows loading placeholders until the author data arrives.

3. **Data Caching**: Once author data is fetched, it's stored and reused. This avoids fetching the same author multiple times.

4. **Modular Comments Component**: Comments are handled in a separate component, which can manage its own data fetching and state.

### Benefits

- **Faster Load Times**: Users see content sooner because the app doesn't wait for all data to load.
- **Better User Experience**: The UI remains responsive, and data loads in the background.
- **Reduced Server Load**: Fewer API calls mean less strain on the server.

## Conclusion

The original code had performance issues due to loading too much data at once and making sequential API calls without caching. The new code improves performance by implementing pagination, fetching data asynchronously, caching results, and modularizing the comments section. These changes lead to a faster, more responsive application that's better for both users and the server.
